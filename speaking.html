            <h2>Speaking Engagements</h2>
            <p>From AI in education to cybersecurity scams, from student success strategies to curriculum design—I've spoken at national conferences, academic summits, and technical events across the country. I bring humor, clarity, and real-world insight to every session. Below are some of the talks I've delivered. Have talks—will travel.</p>

            <h2>Mission Unpromptable: Strategic Assignment Design in the Age of AI</h2></a>
            <p>Mission Unpromptable is a practical workshop for instructors who want to stay one step ahead of AI-generated student work. While we may not be able to stop students from using tools like ChatGPT, we can design smarter assignments — ones that include built-in checks, prompts, or “gotchas” that reveal when the work wasn't done by a human. In this session, we'll explore the kinds of assignments AI handles easily, including a real example where the AI admits (in Dutch) to writing the entire submission. Then we'll look at strategies for redesigning tasks to make them more specific, reflective, and resistant to automation — and how to build in subtle ways to catch misuse when it happens. You'll leave with practical tools to make your assignments harder to fake and easier to trust.</p>

            <h2>Interview with a Scampire</h2></a>
            <p>I will walk you through my interview with "David Jeffries" with Agile Therapeutics, a biotech company offering a remote data analyst role. We settled on a salary, discussed health benefits, and I even negotiated extra vacation days for myself. The only problem? David doesn't exist and neither does the job. David is a scammer impersonating a hiring manager, and if you have applied for jobs online lately, you may have run across this scam. We will discuss the ways scammers find us, the scammer's playbook and the warning signs to look out for, where companies like Microsoft and Zelle can do better to protect the innocent job seeker, and the motivations of the scammers.</p>

            <h2>Using Embedded Student Tutors to Improve Study Habits</h2></a>
            <p>Our students have so many responsibilities. Many of them, if not required to do so, will not put as much time as we'd like into our classes. In STEM classes, that can spell disaster.
            <p>We have had success at Passaic County Community College with embedded tutors, with a few twists. First, we try to find students who recently took the class with us (rather than a professional tutor with a higher-level degree). Second, we get them to attend our lectures and be part of the class community, someone the students see and interact with. Third, the tutors schedule weekly workshops with the students, of which students are required to attend a number (usually, 5) during the semester.</p>
            <p>The combination of working with peers in a low-stakes environment has led to strong results. Among the questions I will answer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a. How do these tutors get paid?</li>
                <li>b. How do I mitigate complaints about the workshops and busy schedules?</li>
                <li>c. Is the success causation or correlation?</li>
                <li>d. How much work does the faculty member have to do?</li>
                <li>e. Are there other rewards aside from improving student success?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(If you can't attend, the short answers to the above questions are: a) grants or course fees, b) "the carrot" works better than the stick, c) more causation than correlation (I believe), d) not as much as you think, and e) yes there are)</p>

            <h2>The Role of Computing in General Education</h2></a>
            <p>This session explores how computing fits into general education requirements across New Jersey's 19 community colleges. Drawing on statewide policy and local practice, it examines how technological competency is defined, implemented, and assessed, highlighting real course examples from Passaic County Community College. With industry calling for adaptable, tech-savvy graduates, the session also addresses the need to move beyond basic skills to foster digital fluency, collaboration, and critical thinking.</p>

            <h2>Internet Forensics</h2></a>
            <p>This interactive session explores how computers support modern police investigations—from databases and fingerprinting software to the realities of digital forensics. We'll also examine common misconceptions spread by pop culture, including myths about DNA turnaround times, RFID tracking, and fingerprint accuracy. A live software demonstration and hands-on activities will give participants a deeper understanding of real-world investigative tools versus TV drama fiction.</p>

            <p>This hands-on session bridges science and technology by introducing participants to digital fingerprint analysis. Following a demonstration by a science faculty member on how to lift latent prints, attendees will learn how to scan those prints into fingerprinting software, enter data into a database, and search for potential matches. The session highlights the real-world applications of biometrics and the role of computing in forensic investigation.</p>

            <h2>Information Literacy Project: A Collaboration between the Library and Computer Science Departments</h2></a>
            <p>The CIS 101 Information Literacy Project equips students with essential research and critical thinking skills by guiding them through five focused sections: web searching, online reference searching, reflective analysis of search tools, website evaluation, and determining online bias. Students practice using specific search engines, online dictionaries, and the PCCC library's resources, then apply evaluation criteria to real web pages. Data from multiple course sections revealed student strengths in finding and defining information, but also highlighted challenges in correctly citing sources, identifying authorship, recognizing bias, and determining site purpose. This presentation reviews project design, student performance trends, and strategies for improving future iterations, with an emphasis on engaging both full-time and adjunct faculty in consistent implementation.</p>
